Verified the auto generated changelog works\n- Improved [bpm-counter](https://github.com/johanbaaij/bpm-counter) docs\n\n## Thoughts\n\n- Would like to generate/include some API docs for [bpm-counter](https://github.com/johanbaaij/bpm-counter) but not sure what the best practises are here. If possible I prefer to avoid redundant/noisy comments for every class and method. Some packages to investigate:\n  - <https://typedoc.org/>\n  - <https://api-extractor.com/>\n\n## Links\n\n- <https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882>\n- <https://moderatemisbehaviour.github.io/clean-code-smells-and-heuristics/>",
