Releases and versioning are automatically taken care of by this [GitHub action](https://github.com/johanbaaij/bpm-counter/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml)\n- Initialized this repository\n\n## Thoughts\n\n- Some benefits of automated semantic-releases:\n  - Forces you to treat `master` as if it may only contain deployable code\n  - Takes the guesswork out of versioning\n  - Sets up your repo for easy contributing and use in the real world\n- It never ceases to amaze me how much tooling and infrastructure is available for open source software\n\n## Links\n\n- <https://www.npmjs.com/package/bpm-counter>\n- <https://github.com/johanbaaij/bpm-counter>\n- <https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release>",
